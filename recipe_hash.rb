# return perfect_10_recipe 
# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.

#2. Write a method that simply returns (not puts) your perfect_10 hash
def recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe
end

#2: Write code that returns the amount of chocolate chips from perfect_10 ingredients that is needed in the recipe.
def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe[:mini_dark_chocolate_chips]
end

#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe.each do |key, value|
    puts "#{key} #{value}"
  end 
end
puts ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
    return perfect_10_recipe.each_key do |key|
      puts "#{key}"
    end
end

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe.each_value do |value|
      puts "#{value}"
    end
end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
  return perfect_10_recipe.size
end
